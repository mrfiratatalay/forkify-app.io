# The Forkify App:

And I took everything I learned in this chapter and put it into one beautiful, modern, and truly advanced application. So I used things like classes, modules, promises, async await, parcel and much more. I also dived even deeper into flowcharts and project architecture in this project, making me more confident and ready to write applications yourself. So, this has been a lot of work but also a lot of fun and that's why I can't wait to finally show you this project.
